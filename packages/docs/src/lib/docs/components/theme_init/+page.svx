title: ThemeInit
---

```typescript
import { ThemeInit } from "@sk-clib/theme"
```

Generates and stores a theme. Place this component in +layout.svelte

Its not implemented yet, planned for v2.0.0, but it would work a little like this:

```html
<script>
    import {theme, ThemeInit} from "@sk-clib/theme"

    // "theme" exposes seedColor, mode, and variant
</script>

<ThemeInit options={{defaultColor: "f8a7c3", defaultMode: "dark", defaultVariant: "vibrant"}}/>
```
